## Overview

OscarPlus: Bi-directional Visoin-Language Representation Learning Based on Oscar

We draw inspiration from Oscar and propose a bi-directional pre-training methodthat integrates the learning of both language and vision at the same time for a unified representation that well grasps both the visual and linguistic features of objects.  We will test  the  learned  representation  on  multiple  V+L  tasks  including image captioning and visual question answering.
